A beginner-friendly data analysis project that helps you learn SQL and data visualization through analyzing retail sales data.

## Project Overview

This project will analyze sales data from a fictional retail store to help understand:
- Sales trends over time
- Product performance
- Customer behavior
- Regional sales patterns
- Revenue analysis

## Step-by-Step Learning Path

### Step 1: Environment Setup
1. Install required tools:
   - Python 3.8 or higher
   - MySQL or PostgreSQL
   - Jupyter Notebook
   - Tableau Public (free version)

2. Install Python packages:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

### Step 2: Data Understanding
We'll work with three main datasets:
1. `sales.csv` - Contains daily sales transactions
2. `products.csv` - Product catalog information
3. `customers.csv` - Customer demographic data

### Step 3: SQL Learning Path
1. Basic SQL Operations
   - SELECT statements
   - WHERE clauses
   - JOIN operations
   - GROUP BY and aggregations
   - ORDER BY and sorting

2. Advanced SQL Concepts
   - Subqueries
   - Window functions
   - Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

### Step 4: Data Analysis
1. Data Cleaning
   - Handling missing values
   - Removing duplicates
   - Data type conversions
   - Data validation

2. Exploratory Data Analysis
   - Summary statistics
   - Distribution analysis
   - Correlation analysis
   - Time series analysis

### Step 5: Visualization
1. Basic Charts
   - Bar charts
   - Line charts
   - Pie charts
   - Scatter plots

2. Advanced Visualizations
   - Heat maps
   - Box plots
   - Geographic maps
   - Interactive dashboards
